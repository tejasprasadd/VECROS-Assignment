# 3D Pathfinding with Conflict Avoidance

Welcome to the **3D Pathfinding with Conflict Avoidance** project! This project is designed to simulate and visualize the movement of multiple agents (e.g., drones, robots) in a 3D environment while avoiding obstacles and collisions. Whether you're a beginner or an industry professional, this README will guide you through the project in a simple and detailed manner.

## Introduction

This project simulates **3D pathfinding** for multiple agents (e.g., drones) in a grid-based environment. The agents must navigate from their starting points to their destinations while:

- Avoiding **obstacles** (e.g., buildings, no-fly zones).
- Avoiding **collisions** with each other.

The project uses the **A\* algorithm** for pathfinding and includes a **conflict detection system** to ensure safe and efficient movement. The results are visualized in an interactive 3D plot.

## How It Works

### 1. 3D Grid Environment

- The environment is a **3D grid** with dimensions `101x101x101` (from `(0,0,0)` to `(100,100,100)`).
- Some grid points are marked as **obstacles** (10% of the grid) with a high weight (`10`), while the rest are free space (`0`).

### 2. Pathfinding with A\*

- Each agent uses the **A\* algorithm** to find the shortest path from its start to its destination.
- The algorithm considers:
  - **Movement costs**: Obstacles are harder to pass through.
  - **Heuristic**: Estimates the remaining distance to the goal using **Chebyshev distance** (optimal for 26-directional movement).

### 3. Conflict Avoidance

- Agents move at a constant speed (`1 grid cell per second`).
- A **buffer zone** ensures agents don’t come too close to each other (default: 2 grid cells).
- If two agents try to occupy the same space at the same time, one will wait or find an alternative path.

### 4. Visualization

- The paths are visualized in **3D** using `matplotlib`.
- Each agent’s path is displayed in a different color.
